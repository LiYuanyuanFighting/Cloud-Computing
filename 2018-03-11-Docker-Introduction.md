# Docker Introduction. 
In Big Data course, we were recommended to use hadoop through 2 ways:  
1. install iso image in virtual machine. 
2. install docker. 
For the 1st approach, I was not new to it, but what is docker, how is it used and what is the benefit compared to VM?  
In the docker main website, it is written:  
> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on  
laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.  

Benefit compared to VM:  
> Docker does not require or include a separate operating system. Instead, it relies on the kernel's functionality and   
uses resource isolation for CPU and memory, and separate namespaces to isolate the application's view of the operating   
system.
